## Introduction

I built this collaboration platform to solve a key problem in teamwork: the disconnect between communication and task management. Teams spend hours in meetings and chats discussing projects, but then face the extra complexity of translating those conversations into actionable tasks. This platform bridges that gap by combining intelligent chat functionality with task management.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Socket.io, Styled Components  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Google Gemini AI  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis

## What Makes This Platform Different

The platform consists of two integrated components that work together to enhance team collaboration:

**Intelligent Chat System:** Real-time messaging with AI-powered task extraction that automatically identifies actionable items from conversations.

**Task Board:** A Kanban board where we can create boards with specific team members and collaborate on tasks.
