# The Chat App - AI-Powered Task Extraction

![Chat app overview](/chat-images/chat-main-interface.png)
*The complete chat interface - where natural conversation becomes structured work*

> **ðŸ§  Innovation Spotlight:** Traditional chat apps store conversations. This one transforms them. Our AI analyzes team discussions in real-time and automatically suggests actionable tasks with confidence scoring, bridging communication and project management seamlessly.

## Introduction

**The challenge I aimed to solve:** Most teams communicate in chat but then have to mentally convert discussions into tasks. This extra step creates decision fatigue and slows down productivity.

**My solution:** Let users chat naturally while an AI assistant analyzes the conversation in real-time and suggests structured tasks. Users can then review and select the tasks AI proposes and assign them directly to specific boards.

**For this feature, I used Google Gemini to transform natural language into actionable tasks, complete with confidence scoring.**

## AI Task Extraction - From Conversation to Action

When teams discuss work in chat, important tasks often get lost in the flow of conversation. I built an AI system that watches these discussions and intelligently extracts actionable itemsâ€”complete with confidence scoring and smart deduplication.

### How the AI Task Extraction Works

The system continuously analyzes team conversations and identifies patterns that indicate work needs to be done. Here's the complete workflow:

**1. Conversation Analysis**
- Monitor the last 50 messages in any chat (configurable context window)
- Include team member context: names, roles, and expertise areas
- Track conversation type (direct message, group chat, or channel)
- Reference recent tasks to avoid suggesting duplicates

**2. Intelligent Task Detection**
- Google Gemini analyzes messages for actionable patterns
- Each potential task gets a confidence score (0-100%)
- AI provides reasoning for why something is considered a task
- Only suggestions above 60% confidence are shown to users

**3. Smart Deduplication**
- Check against existing tasks on the target board
- Use Levenshtein distance algorithm for fuzzy title matching
- 80% similarity threshold prevents near-duplicate creation
- Filter out tasks already discussed or completed

**4. Seamless Task Creation**
- Users review AI suggestions in a clean modal interface
- Bulk selection for creating multiple tasks at once
- One-click assignment to specific boards and columns
- Automatic priority and duration estimation

### The Engineering Behind Cost-Effective AI

Running AI at scale requires careful cost management. Here's how I engineered the system to be both intelligent and economical:

**Rate Limiting Architecture**
- **5 requests per minute** hard limit to prevent runaway costs
- **5-second debounce** between analyses of the same conversation
- **Request deduplication** using content hashing
- **24-hour quota tracking** with automatic reset detection

**Caching Strategy**
- **30-minute cache** for identical conversation analyses
- **Content-based cache keys** to maximize hit rate
- **In-memory storage** with automatic cleanup
- **Cache metrics** to monitor effectiveness

**Quota Management**
- **localStorage persistence** for quota state across sessions
- **Graceful degradation** when daily limits are reached
- **User notifications** with clear reset timing
- **Fallback to manual task creation** when AI unavailable

### Confidence Scoring System

The AI doesn't just find tasksâ€”it tells you how confident it is about each suggestion:

**90-100% Confidence: Explicit Assignments**
- "John, please implement the login fix by Friday"
- "Sarah will handle the database migration"
- Clear owner, clear task, clear timeline

**80-89% Confidence: Clear Action Items**
- "We need to fix the performance issue in the dashboard"
- "The API documentation needs updating"
- Obvious work, but missing specific assignments

**70-79% Confidence: Strong Work Indicators**
- "The search feature is broken"
- "Customers are complaining about load times"
- Problems identified that likely need solutions

**60-69% Confidence: Moderate Suggestions**
- "Maybe we should consider refactoring this module"
- "It might be worth looking into automated testing"
- Potential work that needs human validation

### Production Reliability Features

**Intelligent Retry Logic**
- Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) for transient failures
- Single retry attempt to preserve API quota
- Specific handling for rate limit responses
- Detailed error logging for debugging

**Request Protection**
- Debounce protection against rapid re-analysis
- Request deduplication within 5-second windows
- Memory-based request tracking
- Automatic cleanup of old request records

**Error Recovery**

- Expandable reasoning explanations
- Source message references for context

**Interaction Patterns**
- Click to select/deselect individual tasks
- "Select All" for bulk operations
- Edit task details before creation
- Dismiss suggestions to prevent re-showing

**Visual Feedback**

**Performance Insights:**

**What I learned:** The key insight was that perceived performance matters more than absolute performance. A 3-second AI analysis feels instant when it happens in the background, but a 100ms message delay feels broken. The architecture prioritizes conversation flow while doing intelligent processing asynchronously.

**AI vs Real-Time Balance:** The biggest challenge was balancing AI intelligence with real-time responsiveness. Solution: Never block the conversation flow for AI processing. Extract tasks in the background and surface suggestions contextually.

## Lessons Learned That Changed How I Build

This project taught me fundamental lessons about building intelligent, distributed systems that I'll carry into every future project.

### 1. Intelligence Should Enhance, Not Interrupt

I initially tried to make AI analysis synchronous with message sending. It felt sluggish and broke conversation flow. The breakthrough was realizing AI should augment natural conversation, not control it.

**The shift:** Make the conversation feel instant and natural, then layer intelligence on top asynchronously. Users don't mind waiting 3 seconds for AI suggestions if their messages appear immediately.

### 2. Distributed Systems Need Graceful Degradation

WebSocket clustering introduces complexity, but the payoff is massive scale. However, every distributed component must fail gracefully.

**Key insight:** Design for partial failures. If Redis goes down, individual gateways should still work. If AI APIs fail, chat should continue normally. Users should never experience total system failure because one component has issues.

### 3. Cost Optimization Is Architecture

AI APIs can burn through budgets quickly. I learned that cost optimization isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's a core architectural decision.

**Production approach:** Build cost awareness into every API call. Cache aggressively, rate limit conservatively, and monitor usage religiously. A 30-minute cache reduced API costs by 80% without impacting user experience.

### 4. Context Preservation Is Everything

The magic happens when AI understands not just what people say, but the context of their project, team, and current work.

**The breakthrough:** Don't just analyze isolated messages. Feed AI the project context, team member expertise, recent tasks, and conversation type. Context transforms "fix the bug" into a properly prioritized, assigned task with estimated duration.

### The Core Realization

Building intelligent systems isn't about replacing human communicationâ€”it's about making human communication more productive. The best AI feels invisible until you need it, then delivers exactly what you were thinking about creating anyway.

The architecture that succeeds is one that amplifies human collaboration while handling the complexity of intelligence and scale behind the scenes.
