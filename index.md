## About This Documentation

This documentation showcases the technical architecture and engineering decisions behind CollabSpace's task board system. Written from a senior engineer's perspective, it demonstrates:

- **Systems thinking** in distributed architecture design
- **Real-world trade-offs** between competing technical requirements  
- **User psychology** considerations in collaborative software
- **Production-ready** patterns for performance and reliability

Each section includes the reasoning behind design decisions, alternatives considered, and lessons learned from building a system that handles real-time collaboration at scale.
