##  Projects

### CollabApp - Collaborative Task Management Platform

A collaborative platform that combines a Kanban board with a chat app. What makes it different is an AI feature that turns group conversations into actionable tasks that are registered within the task board.

#### Featured Capabilities:

### ü§ù Collaborative Task Editing

Editing tasks simultaneously is inevitable in collaboration: users get locked out or the system can let conflicts occur and then resolve them. I designed a two-layer solution that addresses conflicts at both the human and technical levels.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Real-time coordination** - Floating chat automatically appears when multiple users edit the same task
- **Presence detection** - WebSockets broadcast who's editing what in real-time
- **Conflict resolution** - Optimistic locking with version control for infrastructure-level resolution
- **Human negotiation** - Editors can coordinate: "I'll update the description, you handle assignees"

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Task Extraction

Traditional chat apps store conversations. This one transforms them. Our AI analyzes team discussions and automatically suggests actionable tasks with confidence scoring, bridging the gap between communication and project management.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Smart extraction** - AI extracts actionable items from natural conversations
- **Confidence scoring** - Tasks are suggested with confidence scores and AI reasoning
- **Deduplication** - Smart prevention of similar tasks being created
- **One-click creation** - Direct task creation from chat conversations
